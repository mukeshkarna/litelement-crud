# Getting Started with PolymerJS and LitElement

This project includes a project code for this [Blog](https://dev.to/mukeshkarna/getting-started-with-polymerjs-and-litelement-293f).

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## Dev Server

This sample uses modern-web.dev's [@web/dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web/dev-server) for previewing the project without additional build steps. Web Dev Server handles resolving Node-style "bare" import specifiers, which aren't supported in browsers. It also automatically transpiles JavaScript and adds polyfills to support older browsers. See [modern-web.dev's Web Dev Server documentation](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) for more information.

To run the dev server and open the project in a new browser tab:

```bash
npm run serve
```


The site will usually be served at http://localhost:8000.
